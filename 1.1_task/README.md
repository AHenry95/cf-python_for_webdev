# Python for Web Developers 1.1: Getting Started with Python

This folder contains some introductory python scripts, as well as a reflection on what I have learned so far. 

## Contents

- `hello.py` - A simple "Hello World!" script
- `add.py` - A script that prompts the user to provide two numbers that are then added together. The sum is returned to the user.
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies for this project

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
mkvirtualenv example-env
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Hello World Script
```bash
python hello.py
```

Expected output:
```
Hello World!
```

### Addition Script
```bash
python add.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter two numbers and will display their sum. Example:

```
Enter your first number: 5
Enter your second number: 5
10
```

## Dependencies

This project uses iPython 8.12.3 for enhanced Python shell capabilities.
