1. I chose a dictionary as that data structure is better suited to storing multiple data values that can be accessed via a single name (the recipe_# names, in this instance).

2. A list is best suited to storing recipe names as each element stored only needs to be the recipe'd id, rather than each piece of data associated with each recipe (name, cooking time, ingredients). A list also provides the ability to add/remove recipes in the future.
